After hours of tinkering and training of Swin Transformer Custom Models, I achieved an accuracy of about ~70% for abnormal classification with an ~83% type (the body part ex: wrist) accuracy.

In this journal you can see the process of my experimentation unfold, with my testing of various hyperparameters, architectures, data manipulation, among many other components.
